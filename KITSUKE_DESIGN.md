# Kitsuke Design

Status: current square-lattice cloth contract

## Purpose

Kitsuke advances the separately positioned pattern parts after Sewing records
exact cross-panel vertex pairs. It must not infer garment fit, volume, intended
Body-relative placement, or a Body-shaped rest curvature.

## Initial state

The first click starts from the current world-space vertices of the source part
objects. The Sewing preview supplies connectivity only. Pattern attributes
supply the intrinsic material metric. Body geometry defines neither initial
positions nor material rest state.

## Free-air dynamics

The external free-air inputs are downward gravity and constant-magnitude seam
attraction. The cloth distributes the seam load using
three Body-independent internal terms:

1. authored rest lengths on all non-proxy material edges;
2. the authored 2D shear metric of each square cell;
3. weak zero-curvature bending along straight warp and weft triples.

The proxy diagonal used to render each square as triangles has no spring. There
is no area-to-Body, normal-to-bone, director, silhouette, or shape-matching term.

## Seam

Every explicit sewing pair has target length zero from runtime creation onward.
Clicks do not shorten, replace, or ratchet this target. Until capture, the force
magnitude is constant and only its direction follows the endpoint line; a 50 cm
and a 5 cm gap therefore receive the same force. At 2 mm, or when the endpoints
cross during a substep, the pair is captured and held at zero distance.

## Body contact

Body is a fixed collider. Candidate lookup uses the evaluated world-space Body
mesh and a 40 mm search radius. A 5 mm contact thickness is applied only in the
contact path. Each contact correction is capped at 0.20 mm per iteration so an
initial penetration is removed gradually rather than becoming an impulse.
Self-contact is absent.

## Runtime control and fixed values

- time step: 1/240 s;
- substeps per click: 8;
- gravity input: nonnegative acceleration in world -Z, default 1.0 m/s²;
- default material/contact iterations: 16;
- seam attraction: 300 force units (300 m/s² at unit inverse mass);
- seam capture distance: 2 mm;
- edge stretch relaxation per sweep: 1.0, with four alternating sweeps;
- quad shear relaxation per iteration: 0.02;
- axial bend relaxation per iteration: 0.0001;
- Body candidate radius: 40 mm;
- Body contact thickness: 5 mm.

Kitsuke reads the gravity field at every click. Changing it during a live
session leaves the current positions and velocities intact; the new value is
used by the next click. A value of 10 therefore applies `(0, 0, -10)` m/s²,
and zero disables gravity.

After the coupled material iterations, additional alternating edge/seam sweeps
converge the strong sewing load into the lattice so a stitch vertex cannot run
ahead and leave a torn one-edge spike.

## Editing and recovery

Moving or rotating a part between clicks replaces that part's positions and
clears its velocity. Scaling and vertex-count changes are rejected. Lock keeps
seam and material connectivity but prevents the locked vertices from moving.

Load stores each part's initial Object Mode matrix. Sewing and Kitsuke omit
parts that still have that matrix, while Auto-locked parts stay in connectivity
as fixed vertices. Auto locks exactly the parts written by the latest completed
Kitsuke step, clears that transient session, and requires a new Sewing action
before the next Kitsuke stage. Unresolvable paths remain pending. A newly moved
part resolves every valid connection available among the current participants,
including one side of a multipart label whose other side is still unmoved.

Undoable state stores seam pairs, the fixed seam state, velocity, revision,
backend, runtime epoch, and Object Mode matrices. Recovery is limited to the
current add-on runtime. A click is rolled back only if the returned particle
state is non-finite; there is no finite-distance movement threshold.
