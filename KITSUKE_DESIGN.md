# Kitsuke Design and Tuning Record

Status: active implementation and empirical tuning  
Recorded: 2026-07-11 (Asia/Tokyo)  
Current tested package: Yohsai 0.1.12, Windows x64, Blender 5.2 / Python 3.13,
Taichi 1.7.4

## 1. Product idea

`Kitsuke` is Yohsai's second central feature. There is no exact English
equivalent for the intended operation, so the button and operation retain the
Japanese name.

A complete physical drape from a poor initial placement often fails. Kitsuke
instead advances only a short, fixed simulation interval. The user alternates
between a physics click and manual Object Mode placement until the garment is
dressed. The current operator is a human. The same explicit operation boundary
may later allow an MCP/LLM agent to perform the placement.

The pattern is authoritative. It completely owns panel topology, vertex
identity, original dimensions, and sewing connectivity. Dressing is only a
physical realization of that data. Topology is never edited during Kitsuke; a
topology change returns to the pattern and starts a new Load.

## 2. Confirmed user workflow

1. `Load` creates one Mesh object for every pattern panel.
2. The user translates and rotates the separate panels around the character.
3. `Sewing` constructs a combined preview with loose sewing edges.
4. The user visually checks sewing correspondence and agreement with the
   pattern. If it is wrong, the user returns to the pattern rather than fixing
   topology in Blender.
5. The user selects the character's actual skin Mesh as `Body`.
6. One `Kitsuke` click constructs transient sewing and physics state, advances a
   short interval, then restores the separate panel objects.
7. The user translates and rotates any one or more objects in Object Mode.
8. Steps 6 and 7 repeat while seams close and the cloth approaches the Body.

Panels have no semantic labels such as front, back, or sleeve in the simulation.
Only the user knows what a panel represents and where it belongs. A sleeve may
contain several panels, and a dress may contain many gores. Yohsai must not infer
garment-part meaning from object identity.

## 3. Persistent and transient representations

The persistent editable representation is always the set of separate panel
objects. A permanently joined Blender Mesh cannot support independent Object
Mode translation and rotation, which are required during dressing.

For each click, Kitsuke performs this round trip:

1. Read current world-space vertices and transforms from all panel objects.
2. Reconstruct one transient indexed simulation state.
3. Reconstruct sewing constraints from the verified Sewing preview/session.
4. Advance Taichi stretch, approximate bend, sewing, gravity, Body contact, and
   self-contact constraints.
5. Scatter positions back by source object and original vertex index.
6. Delete the initial combined Sewing preview after the first click.
7. Show and select the separate panel objects again.

The initial Sewing preview is both a visual verification object and the record
from which the first session captures exact seam vertex pairs. Later clicks keep
that pairing in memory and rebuild only transient constraints.

## 4. Transform and state rules

- Translation and rotation in Object Mode are supported.
- Scaling is rejected because it changes authoritative pattern dimensions.
- Topology or vertex-count changes are rejected.
- An untouched panel retains its per-vertex velocity between clicks.
- A translated or rotated panel has all its vertex velocities reset to zero.
- The evaluated Body is captured on the first click and remains constant.
- Reopening a Blender file does not restore the in-memory Kitsuke session.
- Restarting/upgrading the add-on requires a fresh Load and Sewing.

## 5. Collision rules

- Body contact thickness: 0.002 m.
- Cloth self-contact thickness: 0.002 m.
- Final paired seam distance: 0 m.
- Seam vertices and their immediate connected neighborhoods are excluded from
  conflicting self-contact so paired seams may close to zero.
- Body inside/outside is checked with majority parity over three non-axis-aligned
  ray directions. This tolerates small open features such as eyes better than a
  single ray.
- Initial Body penetration is projected out before dynamic integration.
- Dynamic Body contact uses only the nearest candidate Body triangle for each
  cloth vertex.
- Multiple collision corrections on a vertex are averaged, not summed.

The Body field accepts only an actual Mesh. Character roots, Empty objects, and
Armatures are not colliders. Expand the character hierarchy and select the skin
Mesh itself.

## 6. Current solver and safety constants

Implementation: `kitsuke.py`, Taichi PBD-style Jacobi constraints.

| Parameter | Current value | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Time step | 1/240 s | Small-step stability |
| Substeps per click | 16 | About 1/15 s simulated per click |
| Constraint iterations per substep | 1 | Small Steps strategy |
| Default gravity magnitude | 1.0 m/s² | Interactive tuning value |
| Default seam closure | 30 mm/click | Final target remains 0 mm |
| Velocity damping rate | 4.0/s | Quasi-static dressing bias |
| Maximum velocity | 1.0 m/s | Sixteen substeps remain below the per-click displacement guard |
| Maximum constraint correction | 2 mm/substep | Prevents seam/collision impulses |
| Maximum accepted click displacement | 0.1 m | Larger movement rolls back |
| Collision broad-phase margin | 0.04 m | Reused during one click |

The solver rolls back without writing Blender mesh data if positions or
velocities become non-finite, or if any vertex moves more than 0.1 m in one
click. The error reports the measured maximum displacement.

## 7. Former temporary N-panel tuning controls

Yohsai 0.1.9 temporarily exposed:

- `Gravity` in m/s², default 1.0;
- `Seam Pull (mm/click)`, default 30.

From 0.1.12, these controls are removed from the production N-panel and their
tested values are fixed defaults. The tuning history below is retained as an
engineering record, not as a current user workflow.

Recommended tuning method:

1. Start from the same Load and approximately the same manual placement.
2. Record Gravity and Seam Pull.
3. Press Kitsuke a fixed number of times, initially five.
4. Record vertical drop, seam-distance change, collision failures, and required
   manual interventions.
5. Change only one parameter for the next comparison when possible.
6. Once a useful range is found, repeat with a second garment/placement before
   adopting constants.

Current empirical log:

| Date | Build | Gravity | Seam Pull | Clicks | Observation |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 2026-07-11 | 0.1.6 | 9.81 m/s² | 2 mm | 5 | Stable, but dropped much too quickly and seams remained visibly far apart. |
| 2026-07-11 | 0.1.7 | 1.962 m/s² | 10 mm | 26 | No explosion; panels reached the lower body and produced a recognizable partial drape. Parameter tuning remains necessary. |
| 2026-07-11 | 0.1.9 | 1.0 m/s² | 30 mm | Not recorded | First full real-character dressing result: seams close and the dress follows the torso, waist, hips, and hem. Local Body penetrations remain around the shoulders, chest, and abdomen. |

Append future trials to this table rather than relying on memory alone.

## 8. Observations and change history

### Initial 0.1.4 prototype

The first real character test blew the cloth far away and destroyed its shape.
The cause was not merely stiffness. Body collision corrections from many nearby
triangles were accumulated, distant seam pairs immediately targeted zero, and
large positional corrections became large velocities.

### 0.1.6 stabilization

- changed 1/120 s with five iterations to 1/240 s with one iteration;
- used only the nearest Body triangle;
- averaged collision corrections;
- added per-constraint correction and velocity limits;
- introduced progressive seam closure;
- added invalid-state and excessive-displacement rollback.

The test garment then completed repeated clicks without explosion.

### 0.1.7 rate adjustment

After five real-character clicks, normal gravity caused too much vertical drop
and 2 mm/click seam closure was visibly too weak. Gravity was reduced to one
fifth and seam closure was increased fivefold to 10 mm/click. A subsequent real
test completed 26 clicks and produced a recognizable partial drape around the
lower body without the original explosion. Further empirical tuning is needed.

### 0.1.8 tuning build

Gravity and Seam Pull were exposed in the N-panel. The integration test changes
both values in the middle of an active session, verifies the next click reports
the new values, restores defaults, and continues. The 1,333-vertex,
2,446-triangle fixture remains finite and its mean seam distance decreases over
11 clicks including a translated and rotated panel.

### 0.1.9 tuning build

The next requested trial uses Gravity 1.0 m/s², Seam Pull 30 mm/click, and
sixteen substeps per click. Panel mesh spacing is reduced from 20 mm to 10 mm,
which approximately doubles linear resolution and quadruples face count. Bend
constraint stiffness is reduced from 0.18 to 0.08 while stretch stiffness stays
unchanged so the cloth bends more easily without discarding pattern dimensions.
The maximum velocity is reduced from 2.0 to 1.0 m/s because sixteen substeps at
2.0 m/s could exceed the 0.1 m per-click rollback threshold.

The refined integration fixture contains 4,821 vertices, 9,212 triangles, and
230 sewing constraints. It completes 11 clicks without rollback, including an
Object Mode translation and rotation and a temporary mid-session parameter
change. Mean seam distance decreases over the test.

The first real-character 0.1.9 result reaches a complete recognizable dress
silhouette around the torso and lower body. This validates the incremental
Kitsuke interaction model and the current order of magnitude for gravity and
seam closure. Visible local holes show that collision quality is now the primary
problem: cloth vertices can still cross the Body around high-curvature or
fast-moving regions such as the shoulder, breast, and abdomen.

## 9. Known limitations

- This is stabilized PBD, not a complete XPBD material model.
- Bend resistance uses opposite-vertex distance constraints rather than a full
  dihedral-angle cloth bending constraint.
- Cloth collision is discrete and uses a contact set built once per click.
- The real-character 0.1.9 trial shows remaining Body tunneling/penetration at
  high-curvature regions. Contact refresh or continuous collision detection is
  required before treating collision handling as production-ready.
- Friction is not yet modeled.
- Panel mass and textile-specific stretch/bend parameters are not exposed.
- Runtime state is not serialized.
- The bundled 0.1.12 distribution is Windows x64 / CPython 3.13.
- Taichi wheels make the extension archive approximately 85 MB.

XPBD is a likely later improvement because compliance reduces dependence on
time step and iteration count. It should follow empirical validation of the
current interaction model rather than block tuning of the central workflow.

## 10. Resume checklist

When work resumes:

1. Use `dist/yohsai-0.1.12.zip` unless a newer build exists.
2. Fully close Blender and Blender MCP before replacing the extension, because
   the loaded Taichi native library may lock its wheel files on Windows.
3. Start a new Load/Sewing session after an extension restart.
4. Tune Gravity and Seam Pull with repeated real-character trials.
5. Record the garment, initial placement, parameter pair, click count, and
   outcome for each meaningful trial.
6. Do not remove the temporary controls until values work on more than one
   garment/placement.
7. After adopting final constants, remove or hide the temporary tuning box,
   update this record, bump the build version, rebuild, and rerun packaged
   integration tests.
