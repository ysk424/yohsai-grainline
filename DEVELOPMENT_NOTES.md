# Yohsai Development Notes

Status: public development preview.

Current version: 0.4.1.

The authoritative Kitsuke design, tuning log, known limitations, and resume
checklist are maintained in `KITSUKE_DESIGN.md`.
The v0.4 native Stable Cosserat backend and its acceptance record are maintained
in `COSSERAT_DESIGN.md`; `KITSUKE_DESIGN.md` retains the legacy Taichi baseline.
The product-level pattern-designer perspective and anti-drift rules are
authoritative in `DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md`.
The latest tested handoff, deferred issues, release procedure, and next priority
are summarized in `SESSION_MEMORY.md`.

## First v0.4 Owner Acceptance

On 2026-07-14, the installed Stable Cosserat build was accepted in interactive
testing: no visible Body penetration was observed, CPU response was considered
practical, and its behavior was judged closer to the intended result than the
project's XPBD and finite-element prototypes. This is qualitative owner
feedback; it does not replace measured benchmarks or automated regression
tests. The owner also reported lower-than-expected implementation time and
model-token use.

## 0.4.1 Mesh Density

Version 0.4.1 halves the nominal cloth spacing from 10 mm to 5 mm. On the fixed
`test2.pdf` integration input, the two panels now contain 19,454 vertices and
38,030 triangles, with 448 sewing constraints. The previous 0.4.0 mesh had
4,821 vertices, so the new vertex count is 4.035 times larger.

The source integration test completed ten Stable Cosserat Kitsuke operations
without rollback on 2026-07-14. The complete Load, Sewing, Kitsuke, and Update
test took 388.210 seconds on the development machine. A density-only Load and
Sewing check took 4.714 seconds. These timings are regression observations for
this machine, not cross-machine performance guarantees. High-density testing
also exposed and fixed a quaternion-normalization mismatch between live
continuation and Undo reconstruction; replay now has zero state and seam delta.

The first real-character 0.1.9 trial produces a recognizable fitted dress from
the incremental workflow. Remaining visible holes at the shoulder, chest, and
abdomen make Body contact refinement the next primary engineering task.

## Version and Build Policy

Extension versions use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. A feature milestone may increment
MINOR and reset PATCH, as 0.2.0 does for Undo/Redo synchronization; subsequent
compatible fixes increment PATCH. Every distributed build must have a version
not previously distributed. The version in `blender_manifest.toml`, the
documented current version, and the generated archive name must agree.

Existing project documentation and specifications must remain in the repository
when a new build is produced. Amend or supersede them explicitly instead of
silently removing the current record.

This repository is public-facing but still under active development. Interfaces,
data formats, utility output details, and packaging may change before a stable
release.

## Direction

The Illustrator PDF pattern and its annotations are the source of truth.
The implemented pipeline parses that pattern to fixed JSON, cuts separate
triangular panel meshes, verifies Sewing, and incrementally dresses them with
Kitsuke. Update recuts labeled panels while transferring only a useful initial
3D placement. Future work must extend this pattern-designer workflow instead of
treating Blender mesh identity as authoritative.

## Current State

- The add-on registers a `Yohsai` N-panel in the 3D View sidebar.
- The N-panel groups Pattern Path, Clothes, and Body at the top, followed only
  by Lock/Auto and the four primary actions: Load, Update, Sewing, and Kitsuke.
  Lock marks selected mesh objects as excluded from Kitsuke deformation. It is
  an exclusive staging set: checking Lock switches the locked set to the current
  selection, and unchecking clears the selected Clothes lock state. Auto is
  present as a reserved button and has no automatic behavior yet.
- `Pattern Path` and `Load` accept PDF, run the parser in a separate process,
  and asynchronously load its fixed, atomically written JSON result. PDF uses
  bundled `pypdf` and `typing_extensions` wheels. SVG input is no longer
  supported.
- Load expands fold-cut panels and `@M` mirror instances. Two `RING` boundaries
  are sampled equally and welded after `@TOP`-oriented tube construction. Load
  creates one packed, cloth-ready triangular Mesh object per resulting instance
  in a new numbered `CLOTHES_###` collection. Sewing and fold membership are
  preserved as mesh attributes; RING is a reserved construction word.
- `#` text inside a panel provides a normalized, human-authored identity for
  Update. Whitespace is removed; ASCII letters compare case-insensitively; and
  digits, underscore, and hyphen are accepted.
- `Update` asynchronously rereads the same PDF, recuts all labeled panels,
  transfers the current 3D pose through stored flat-pattern coordinates, and
  atomically swaps new Mesh datablocks into the existing objects. New pattern
  geometry owns rest lengths and velocities reset to zero.
- Unchanged sewing signatures remain verified across Update. Changed sewing
  membership invalidates verification, and Kitsuke reports `Sewing required`
  until the independent Sewing operation succeeds again.
- `Sewing` orders each marked boundary path, infers its direction from the
  positioned world-space endpoints, and creates a combined mesh with loose
  sewing-spring edges. A closed RING sleeve path pairs with the virtual loop
  formed by its front and back body paths. The separate source parts remain
  hidden in the same collection for future update work.
- `Kitsuke` treats the separate panel objects as the editable 3D realization.
  The first click constructs transient native Stable Cosserat edge frames,
  VBD positions, sewing, Body-contact, and self-contact state; later clicks
  reuse it while synchronizing supported Object Mode placement. The original
  Taichi implementation remains selectable as `Legacy Taichi PBD`. Each click
  advances a fixed short interval and scatters the result back to the original
  objects. Translation and rotation clear velocity only on the moved parts.
  Sewing maximum distances close by 30 mm per click and ratchet down whenever
  the current seam distance becomes shorter. Seam projection runs after Body
  and self-contact; if a small garment cannot satisfy every constraint, seam
  separation is treated as the unacceptable failure mode, while nearby cloth
  distortion or Body penetration is accepted as the lesser failure. Gravity
  defaults to 1.0 m/s². Stable Cosserat uses eight 1/240-second substeps,
  sixteen alternating iterations by default, capped 0.5 mm Body corrections,
  and bounded 1.0 m/s velocity. Body contact uses one nearest triangle per
  nearby or penetrating cloth vertex; unstable steps are rolled back before
  Blender mesh data is changed.
  Locked mesh objects remain in the sewing graph but their vertices are fixed
  during Kitsuke; this supports staged dressing and future part-addition
  workflows without inferring garment semantics.
  Gravity and seam closure use the tested fixed defaults and are intentionally
  absent from the production N-panel.
- Each successful Kitsuke click mirrors the non-undoable runtime's exact seam
  pairs and targets, per-vertex velocities, revision, and transforms into
  Blender data. Undo/Redo handlers discard the stale Taichi objects; the next click reconstructs them
  from the state restored by Blender. A new Blender/add-on runtime ignores the
  old recovery epoch. Cross-restart continuation of a partially dressed state
  is unsupported; the supported workflow starts again from Load/Sewing.
- PDF parsing emits explicitly closed line/cubic paths containing unique `#`
  labels. Unlabeled closed artwork still participates in containment testing,
  so it must not enclose a labeled panel in the current implementation. PDF
  page points supply physical scale. `@S<number>cm` is no longer required and
  is rejected as obsolete metadata. The contract is documented in
  `SVG_TO_JSON_SPEC.md`.
- The panel owns a mesh body pointer, with Blender's object selector/eyedropper.
- `UTIL/silhouette_export.py` is a standalone `bpy` preparation script for the
  Scripting workspace. It exports XZ and YZ orthographic silhouette SVGs and is
  normally run once per character; it is not registered as an add-on operator.
- No Blender Cloth modifier is used. The active Taichi runtime is in memory;
  Blender data contains only same-runtime Undo/Redo recovery state. Reopening
  and continuing a partially dressed session is unsupported.

## Known implementation gaps intentionally deferred

- Same-vertex-count topology edits and direct vertex edits are unsupported but
  are not yet reliably rejected. Pattern topology must be changed in Illustrator.
- PDF close-and-paint operators and implicit fill closure are not yet treated as
  explicit closed panels; current Illustrator test data uses an explicit close.
- The intended annotation contract is ASCII-only, but validation still has a
  known Unicode case-folding gap. Do not depend on accidental acceptances.
