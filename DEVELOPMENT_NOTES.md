# Yohsai Development Notes

Status: public development preview.

Current version: 0.3.0.

The authoritative Kitsuke design, tuning log, known limitations, and resume
checklist are maintained in `KITSUKE_DESIGN.md`.
The product-level pattern-designer perspective and anti-drift rules are
authoritative in `DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md`.
The latest tested handoff, deferred issues, release procedure, and next priority
are summarized in `SESSION_MEMORY.md`.

The first real-character 0.1.9 trial produces a recognizable fitted dress from
the incremental workflow. Remaining visible holes at the shoulder, chest, and
abdomen make Body contact refinement the next primary engineering task.

## Version and Build Policy

Extension versions use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. A feature milestone may increment
MINOR and reset PATCH, as 0.2.0 does for Undo/Redo synchronization; subsequent
compatible fixes increment PATCH. Every distributed build must have a version
not previously distributed. The version in `blender_manifest.toml`, the
documented current version, and the generated archive name must agree.

Existing project documentation and specifications must remain in the repository
when a new build is produced. Amend or supersede them explicitly instead of
silently removing the current record.

This repository is public-facing but still under active development. Interfaces,
data formats, utility output details, and packaging may change before a stable
release.

## Direction

The Illustrator PDF pattern and its annotations are the source of truth.
The implemented pipeline parses that pattern to fixed JSON, cuts separate
triangular panel meshes, verifies Sewing, and incrementally dresses them with
Kitsuke. Update recuts labeled panels while transferring only a useful initial
3D placement. Future work must extend this pattern-designer workflow instead of
treating Blender mesh identity as authoritative.

## Current State

- The add-on registers a `Yohsai` N-panel in the 3D View sidebar.
- The N-panel groups Pattern Path, Clothes, and Body at the top, followed only
  by Lock/Auto and the four primary actions: Load, Update, Sewing, and Kitsuke.
  Lock marks selected mesh objects as excluded from Kitsuke deformation. It is
  an exclusive staging set: checking Lock switches the locked set to the current
  selection, and unchecking clears the selected Clothes lock state. Auto is
  present as a reserved button and has no automatic behavior yet.
- `Pattern Path` and `Load` accept PDF, run the parser in a separate process,
  and asynchronously load its fixed, atomically written JSON result. PDF uses
  bundled `pypdf` and `typing_extensions` wheels. SVG input is no longer
  supported.
- Load expands fold-cut panels and `@M` mirror instances. Two `RING` boundaries
  are sampled equally and welded after `@TOP`-oriented tube construction. Load
  creates one packed, cloth-ready triangular Mesh object per resulting instance
  in a new numbered `CLOTHES_###` collection. Sewing and fold membership are
  preserved as mesh attributes; RING is a reserved construction word.
- `#` text inside a panel provides a normalized, human-authored identity for
  Update. Whitespace is removed; ASCII letters compare case-insensitively; and
  digits, underscore, and hyphen are accepted.
- `Update` asynchronously rereads the same PDF, recuts all labeled panels,
  transfers the current 3D pose through stored flat-pattern coordinates, and
  atomically swaps new Mesh datablocks into the existing objects. New pattern
  geometry owns rest lengths and velocities reset to zero.
- Unchanged sewing signatures remain verified across Update. Changed sewing
  membership invalidates verification, and Kitsuke reports `Sewing required`
  until the independent Sewing operation succeeds again.
- `Sewing` orders each marked boundary path, infers its direction from the
  positioned world-space endpoints, and creates a combined mesh with loose
  sewing-spring edges. A closed RING sleeve path pairs with the virtual loop
  formed by its front and back body paths. The separate source parts remain
  hidden in the same collection for future update work.
- `Kitsuke` treats the separate panel objects as the editable 3D realization.
  The first click constructs transient Taichi stretch, bend, sewing,
  body-contact, and self-contact state; later clicks reuse it while synchronizing
  supported Object Mode placement. Each click advances a fixed short interval
  and scatters the result back to the original objects. Translation and rotation
  clear velocity only on the moved parts.
  Sewing maximum distances close by 30 mm per click and ratchet down whenever
  the current seam distance becomes shorter. Seam projection runs after Body
  and self-contact; if a small garment cannot satisfy every constraint, seam
  separation is treated as the unacceptable failure mode, while nearby cloth
  distortion or Body penetration is accepted as the lesser failure. Gravity
  defaults to 1.0 m/s², and each click uses sixteen 1/240-second substeps. Bend
  stiffness is reduced from 0.18 to 0.08, maximum constraint correction is
  10 mm/substep, and maximum velocity is 1.0 m/s. Body contact uses one nearest
  triangle per cloth vertex, collision corrections are averaged, and unstable
  steps are rolled back before Blender mesh data is changed.
  Locked mesh objects remain in the sewing graph but their vertices are fixed
  during Kitsuke; this supports staged dressing and future part-addition
  workflows without inferring garment semantics.
  Gravity and seam closure use the tested fixed defaults and are intentionally
  absent from the production N-panel.
- Each successful Kitsuke click mirrors the non-undoable runtime's exact seam
  pairs and targets, per-vertex velocities, revision, and transforms into
  Blender data. Undo/Redo handlers discard the stale Taichi objects; the next click reconstructs them
  from the state restored by Blender. A new Blender/add-on runtime ignores the
  old recovery epoch. Cross-restart continuation of a partially dressed state
  is unsupported; the supported workflow starts again from Load/Sewing.
- PDF parsing emits explicitly closed line/cubic paths containing unique `#`
  labels. Unlabeled closed artwork still participates in containment testing,
  so it must not enclose a labeled panel in the current implementation. PDF
  page points supply physical scale. `@S<number>cm` is no longer required and
  is rejected as obsolete metadata. The contract is documented in
  `SVG_TO_JSON_SPEC.md`.
- The panel owns a mesh body pointer, with Blender's object selector/eyedropper.
- `UTIL/silhouette_export.py` is a standalone `bpy` preparation script for the
  Scripting workspace. It exports XZ and YZ orthographic silhouette SVGs and is
  normally run once per character; it is not registered as an add-on operator.
- No Blender Cloth modifier is used. The active Taichi runtime is in memory;
  Blender data contains only same-runtime Undo/Redo recovery state. Reopening
  and continuing a partially dressed session is unsupported.

## Known implementation gaps intentionally deferred

- Same-vertex-count topology edits and direct vertex edits are unsupported but
  are not yet reliably rejected. Pattern topology must be changed in Illustrator.
- PDF close-and-paint operators and implicit fill closure are not yet treated as
  explicit closed panels; current Illustrator test data uses an explicit close.
- The intended annotation contract is ASCII-only, but validation still has a
  known Unicode case-folding gap. Do not depend on accidental acceptances.
