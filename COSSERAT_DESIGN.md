# Native Kitsuke Solver Design

Status: current native runtime contract

The DLL name retains `cosserat` for package compatibility. The active runtime is
a Body-independent square-lattice cloth solver with a version-7 C ABI.

## State and topology

The runtime stores particle position, previous position, velocity, inverse mass,
and Lock state. The creation descriptor also contains:

- constant-distance seam attraction with zero-length capture;
- non-proxy material edges and their authored rest lengths;
- ordered square cells and the authored 2D metric of each cell;
- straight warp/weft triples and their two segment lengths;
- a fixed Body triangle snapshot used only for collision.

All material rest data comes from the loaded pattern. Body vertices, Body
normals, bones, and the current Body silhouette never define cloth rest data.

## Material energy

Warp, weft, and boundary-transition edges preserve their authored lengths in
both directions. Every sweep aims at the rest length; only the firmness varies.
Within `stretch_limit` of rest the pull is `stretch_relaxation`, the weave's own
crimp give; outside it the pull is total. Aiming at the bound rather than at
rest would leave a span just past the reserve stretched further than one just
inside it.

Compression is resisted as firmly as extension. A yarn does not elongate, and
the centimetre between two crossings does not shorten either: cloth folds by
bending the lattice out of plane, with its cells still a centimetre across.
Letting a span collapse instead makes compression a one-way ratchet, because a
span shorter than rest would never be visited again, and the panel silently
loses the dimensions the pattern authored.

Because a Gauss-Seidel pass carries a length correction only about one span
further into the sheet, the edge sweeps repeat within each iteration. A single
pass per iteration never reaches the middle of a panel, which is the part
furthest from any anchor, and the lattice then grows under load instead of
settling onto its authored spacing.

For an ordered quad `(x0, x1, x2, x3)`, the averaged material spans are

```
u = ((x1 - x0) + (x2 - x3)) / 2
v = ((x3 - x0) + (x2 - x1)) / 2
```

The shear term reduces `dot(u, v) - rest_uv`. Edge lengths supply the two axial
metric terms, so the triangulation diagonal is only a rendering proxy and does
not become an artificial spring.

For each collinear warp/weft triple `(a, b, c)`, the weak bending term reduces

```
(xa - xb) / rest_ab + (xc - xb) / rest_bc
```

This expression is zero for a straight material row under any rigid transform.
It contains no preferred Body-shaped arch.

## Substep

Each substep performs:

1. a distance-independent positional seam drag for every uncaptured pair;
2. velocity/position prediction from existing velocity and gravity;
3. seam-capture detection, then iterative captured-seam, quad-shear,
   axial-bend, and edge sweeps;
4. Body contact correction for supplied candidates;
5. velocity reconstruction from the accepted position change.

Forward and reverse sweeps alternate to reduce ordering bias. Every local
correction is mass weighted and bounded. The uncaptured seam closure is a fixed
distance, independent of how far apart the pair still is. At 2 mm or after
endpoint crossing, the pair is captured at zero distance. There is no
seam-target shortening, Body attraction, shape matching, self-contact, or speed
clamp.

Sewing is an operator instruction rather than a force, so it must not become
momentum. The drag is applied ahead of the prediction, which rebases `previous`
onto the dragged position and keeps the pull itself out of the reconstructed
velocity; the endpoints of an uncaptured pair then take zero velocity for that
substep, which keeps the material's reaction to the drag out of it as well.
Admitting one and not the other would make each substep a one-way momentum
source or sink, and the pair would accelerate itself. The drag runs once per
substep, so `iterations` stays a convergence control and does not change how
fast a seam sews shut.

## Contact

Body contact is dissipative only. A contacting vertex retains
`contact_velocity_retention` of its velocity, so contact can remove kinetic
energy but never add any and Body motion cannot fling the cloth. Gravity
re-drives the span every substep, so cloth still creeps over the Body and
settles rather than sticking where it first touched. Vertices that are not
contacting keep their inertia.

## Safety

Inputs and committed state must be finite. Invalid topology and indices are
rejected. The Blender layer rolls back a click only if state becomes non-finite;
finite particle movement has no rollback threshold. Body triangles remain
collision input only.
